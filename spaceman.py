    Our stranded spaceman has found a rocket to get home with. One problem- 
    It's locked! There's a keypad attatched to both a geiger counter, and 
    the lock on the hatch. The pad takes a code word, but he can't reach! 
    Can you help the spaceman beat Schrodingers;Hatch and get back home? 

    It's exactly as easy as it seems. Good luck, you're going to need it.

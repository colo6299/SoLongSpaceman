# So long, Spaceman.
So. I should preface this by saying this is neither good code, nor a good program for the project spec. I apologize. 
That being said, this is the coolest zero I've ever scored on a rubric... my ~hangman~ spaceman project does not generate a word. 

If you had a one letter blank and you knew it was either going to be the word "A" or the word "I", If you guess "A" you have a 50% chance of being right. After all, you don't know which word is hidden behind the screen. No amount of skill or knowledge can change that. The computer knows, but you are left to guess, after all this is ~hangman~ spaceman. We're both here on github today because my strong sense of justice has compelled me to write a ~hangman~ spaceman program that's as clueless as the rest of us! 

This ~hangman~ spaceman program calulates the odds of any particular guess being correct and just... rolls the dice. No word generation, no matching letters, nothing! It simply\* places\*\* your guess somewhere\*\*\* in the answer string and recalculates the odds for next time.
Simple\*\*\*\*, really. And yes, if I didn't tell you this you would't be able to tell the difference- this is mathematically identical to a normal game of ~hangman~ spaceman. In other words, this *may* have been a waste of time.
